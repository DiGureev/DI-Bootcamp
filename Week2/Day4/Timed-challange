# Count Occurence
# Write a program which takes a string and a character as an input, and finds out the number of occurrences the character has in the string.

# String: Programming is cool!
# Character: o
# 3


# String: This is a great example
# Character: y
# 0

user_string = input('Give me a string: ')
user_letter = input('Which letter i will count? ')

def count_letter(string,letter):
    count = 0
    for i in string:
        if i == letter:
            count +=1
    print(f"String: {string}\nCharacter: {letter}\n{count}")

count_letter('This is a cool string', 's')

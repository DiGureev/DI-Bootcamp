# Count Occurence
# Write a program which takes a string and a character as an input, and finds out the number of occurrences the character has in the string.

# String: Programming is cool!
# Character: o
# 3


# String: This is a great example
# Character: y
# 0

# user_string = input('Give me a string: ')
# user_letter = input('Which letter i will count? ')

# def count_letter():
#     count = 0
#     for i in user_string:
#         if i == user_letter:
#             count +=1
#     print(f"String: {user_string}\nCharacter: {user_letter}\n{count}")

# count_letter()

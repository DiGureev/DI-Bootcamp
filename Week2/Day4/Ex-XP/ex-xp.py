# Exercise 1 : What Are You Learning ?
# Instructions
# Write a function called display_message() that prints 
#one sentence telling everyone what you are learning in this course.
# Call the function, and make sure the message displays correctly.

#ANSWER

# def display_message():
#     print('We are learning functions')

# display_message()


# üåü Exercise 2: What‚Äôs Your Favorite Book ?
# Instructions
# Write a function called favorite_book() that accepts one parameter called 
# title.
# The function should print a message, such as "One of my favorite books 
# is <title>".
# For example: ‚ÄúOne of my favorite books is Alice in Wonderland‚Äù
# Call the function, make sure to include a book title as an argument 
# when calling the function.

#ANSWER

# def favorite_book(title):
#     print(f'So, your fav book is {title}')

# title = input('What is your fav book?\n')
# favorite_book(title)

# üåü Exercise 3 : Some Geography
# Instructions
# Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a city and its country as parameters.
# The function should print a simple sentence, such as "<city> is in <country>".
# For example ‚ÄúReykjavik is in Iceland‚Äù
# Give the country parameter a default value.
# Call your function.

#ANSWER

# def describe_city(city, country = 'Israel'):
#     print(f'{city} in {country}')

# describe_city('TLV')

# Exercise 4 : Random
# Instructions
# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 and generates 
#another number randomly between 1 and 100.
# Compare the two numbers, if it‚Äôs the same number, display a success message,
# otherwise show a fail message and display both numbers.

#ANSWER

# import random

# a = random.randrange(1,100)

# def rand_number():
#     b = random.randrange(1,100)
#     if a == b:
#         print('Wow! You won!')
#     else:
#         print(f'Fail! {a} and {b} are not the same')

# rand_number()

# üåü Exercise 5 : Let‚Äôs Create Some Personalized Shirts !
# Instructions
# Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the text of 
#a message that should be printed on the shirt.
# The function should print a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and 
#the message printed on it, such as "The size of the shirt is <size> and the 
#text is <text>"
# Call the function make_shirt().
# Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are large by default with 
# a message that reads ‚ÄúI love Python‚Äù by default.

#ANSWER

# def make_shirt(size = 'Large',text = 'I love Python'):
#     print(f'Your size is {size}, your text will be "{text}"')

# make_shirt()

# Make a large shirt with the default message

#ANSWER

# size = input('Your size?\n')

# def make_shirt(size,text="I love python"):
#     print(f'Your size is {size}, your text will be "{text}"')

# if size == "Large":
#     make_shirt('Large')

# def make_shirt(size,text="I love python"):
#     print(f'Your size is {size}, your text will be "{text}"')

# if size == "Medium":
#     make_shirt('Medium')
# else:
#     text = input('Your text?\n')
#     make_shirt(size,text)

# üåü Exercise 6 : Magicians ‚Ä¶
# Instructions
# Using this list of magician‚Äôs names

# magician_names = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']

# Create a function called show_magicians(), which prints the name of each magician in the list.

# def show_magicians():
#     print(str(magician_names))

#show_magicians()

# Write a function called make_great() that modifies the original list of magicians by adding the phrase "the Great" to each magician‚Äôs name.
# Call the function make_great().
# Call the function show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

# magician_names = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']

# def make_great():
#     for index, name in enumerate(magician_names):
#         new_name = name + ' ' + 'The Great'
#         magician_names[index] = new_name
#     print(str(magician_names))

# make_great()

# üåü Exercise 7 : Temperature Advice
# Instructions
# Create a function called get_random_temp().
# This function should return an integer between -10 and 40 degrees (Celsius), selected at random.
# Test your function to make sure it generates expected results.
# Create a function called main().
# Inside this function, call get_random_temp() to get a temperature, and store its value in a variable.
# Inform the user of the temperature in a friendly message, eg. ‚ÄúThe temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.‚Äù
# Let‚Äôs add more functionality to the main() function. Write some friendly advice relating to the temperature:
# below zero (eg. ‚ÄúBrrr, that‚Äôs freezing! Wear some extra layers today‚Äù)
# between zero and 16 (eg. ‚ÄúQuite chilly! Don‚Äôt forget your coat‚Äù)
# between 16 and 23
# between 24 and 32
# between 32 and 40

# import random

# def get_random_temp():
#     return random.randrange(-10,40)

# def main():
#     a = get_random_temp()
#     if a < 0:
#         print(f'Temperature is {a} degrees Celsius. Brrr, thats freezing! Wear some extra layers today')
#     elif a < 16:
#         print(f'Temperature is {a} degrees Celsius. Quite chilly! Dont forget your coat.')
#     elif a <= 23:
#         print(f'Temperature is {a} degrees Celsius. Quite hot! Drink more water')
#     elif a < 32:
#         print(f'Temperature is {a} degrees Celsius. Looks like summer! Dont forget a hat')
#     else:
#         print(f'Temperature is {a} degrees Celsius. Hot as hell! Drink more water')

# main()

# Change the get_random_temp() function:
# Add a parameter to the function, named ‚Äòseason‚Äô.
# Inside the function, instead of simply generating a random number between -10 and 40, 
#set lower and upper limits based on the season, eg. if season is ‚Äòwinter‚Äô, temperatures should only fall 
#between -10 and 16.
# Now that we‚Äôve changed get_random_temp(), let‚Äôs change the main() function:
# Before calling get_random_temp(), we will need to decide on a season, so that we can call the function correctly. 
#Ask the user to type in a season - ‚Äòsummer‚Äô, ‚Äòautumn‚Äô (you can use ‚Äòfall‚Äô if you prefer), ‚Äòwinter‚Äô, or ‚Äòspring‚Äô.
# Use the season as an argument when calling get_random_temp().

# import random

# def get_random_temp(season):
#     if season == 1 or season == 2 or season == 12:
#         temp = random.randrange(-10,16)
#     elif season == 3 or season == 4 or season == 5:
#         temp = random.randrange(16,25)
#     elif season == 6 or season == 7 or season == 8:
#         temp = random.randrange(25,40)
#     elif season == 9 or season == 10 or season == 11:
#         temp = random.randrange(14,20)
# # Bonus: Give the temperature as a floating-point number instead of an integer.
#     print(f'Its {float(temp)} degrees Celsium')
    
# get_random_temp(3)

# Bonus: Instead of asking for the season, ask the user for the number of the month (1 = January, 12 = December). Determine the season according to the month.


# üåü Exercise 8 : Star Wars Quiz
# Instructions

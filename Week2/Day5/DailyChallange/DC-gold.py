# Instructions
# Here is a python code that generate a list of 20000 random numbers, called list_of_numbers.
# Extend this code to guess how many couples of numbers in list_of_numbers sum to target_number.

# import random

# list_of_numbers = [random.randint(0, 10000) for _ in range(20000)]
# target_number   = 3728

# count_couples = 0

# for index, num in enumerate(list_of_numbers[::-1]):
#     if num + list_of_numbers[index-1] == 3728:
#         count_couples +=1
# print(count_couples)
